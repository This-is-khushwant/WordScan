# WordScan

WordScan is a Python-based application designed to process document photos by enhancing the text within them. It extracts text from images and provides concise summaries, making it easier to understand and analyze the content.

## Features

- **Text Enhancement**: Improves the clarity and readability of text within document photos.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
- **Summarization**: Generates concise summaries of the extracted text for quick comprehension.
